# Road-Damages-and-Hazard-Report-App
This app lets users report road issues by marking the location, selecting the damage type, rating severity, adding details, and uploading photos. Built with Survey123 on AGOL, it streamlines field data collection and sends reports directly to county staff for quick action.
