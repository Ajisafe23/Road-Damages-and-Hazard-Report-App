# Road-Damages-and-Hazard-Report-App
This app lets users report road issues by marking the location, selecting the damage type, rating severity, adding details, and uploading photos. Built with Survey123 on AGOL, it streamlines field data collection and sends reports directly to county staff for quick action.
Road Damages and Hazard Report Application
Introduction

The Road Damages and Hazard Report Application is an interactive, GIS-based data collection tool designed to support proactive road maintenance within Wayne County. The application enables field crews and authorized personnel to capture accurate, real-time information about roadway damages and hazards before they escalate into major issues or generate resident complaints. By integrating geolocation, imagery, and structured reporting fields, this tool strengthens infrastructure monitoring and improves public safety.

**Description**

This application allows users to document road-related issues by pinpointing the location of the hazard, identifying the type of damage, rating its severity, adding descriptive details, and uploading supporting photos. Built using Survey123 on ArcGIS Online (AGOL), the system streamlines field data collection and ensures that all submitted reports are automatically routed to the appropriate county department for timely action. The application functions as a central platform for capturing consistent and high-quality road condition data.

**Objective**

The primary objective of this application is to:

Enable proactive identification of road damages and hazards.

Provide a structured method for collecting geospatial information on roadway issues.

Improve response times by delivering data directly to responsible authorities.

Enhance road safety and reduce the likelihood of accidents or public complaints.

Support data-driven infrastructure planning and maintenance prioritization.
